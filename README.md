## Schedule

### 1. September 19th

Introductions.

#### Assignment  
* On a breadboard, build a circuit with a STDP switch, one or more LEDS using cureent limiting resistors.
* On a breadboard, build an inverter circuit using a transistor.
* Use another construction method to build a functional circuit. ie. cardboard w/ copper tape, freeform wire sculpture, using found conductive elements...

#### Resources
* [How to read a MSDS for beginners](https://justinlavallee.pages.cba.mit.edu/tutorials/how-to-read-SDS/index.html)
* [Resistor tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors)
* [Overview of terminology](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html)

### 2. September 26th

Binary Logic

#### Assignment 

* Logic gate sketching.

Use whatever medium you would like to create / express / evoke / render a digital logic gate. The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the physical structure of something that is normally experienced as an abstract model or is so small it is impossible to see. Use existing notation, make up your own, have fun with this.

These can and should feel like sketches. Ie. when you  sketch a face, or a tree over and over you build a mental model of it and begin to understand it differently. We'll look these over in class + will present at final show.

* Build logic gates *AND*, *NAND*, *OR* using transistors.

* Bonus high fives if you get to *XOR*. We're going to leave out *XNOR* and *NOR*.

### 3. October 3nd

Combining Logic

#### Assignment 

* Build a half-adder from your parts from last week’s assignment.
* Build a full-adder (combine parts with a partner)
* Distributed SFPC full adder. Combine full-adders to form an 8-bit adder circuit as a class. Install in SFPC? (*** question about space). Consider input switches, outputs etc.
* Design any logic gate or a full-adder in Eagle.

### 4. October 10th

Memory + Oscillators

#### Assignment 

* Build an oscillator from a Schmitt trigger inverter (or NAND).
* Experiment in changing your oscillator frequency using varying resistors + capacitors.
* Wire up a D-flip flop. See how it works.
* Connect a D-flip flop to your oscillator to divide the signal by 2. Get it down to 1hz.
* Examine signal on oscilloscope, with LED, with piezo.
Bonus : try and build an oscillator in a different way, what happens if you connect a series of inverters in sequence.


#### Resources  

* [Crystal oscillators](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/oscillator/crystal.html)
* [555 timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC)

### 5.5 Saturday bonus fabrication methods @ CW&T Studio

CW&T studio visit. Overview and demo of various fabrication machines.

#### Assignment 
* Post an RFQ (request for quotes) on [MFG](mfg.com)
Build a 3D model, shop drawings, or hand sketch and post an RFQ (request for quotes) on MFG.com. The part should be made of one material and one fabrication process. Get quotes for quantities of 2, 200, and 4,000.

#### Resources  
CNC Mill
CNC Lathe
Laser cutter
3D printer

### 5. October 17th

Microcontroller. Serial In/Out. Interface with OF/P5

#### Assignment 

* Tele-something. Build something that responds to an input from somewhere far away. (eg. Mouse click -> LED blink, Lots of mouse clicks -> lots of LEDs blinking)  
* Bonus: Make your thing respond to something over the internet.


#### Resources

### 6. October 24rd

Custom Inputs. Sensors.

#### Assignment 

* Touch me or don’t touch me. Build a custom sensor that senses something happened or didn’t happen.  (eg. touch, weight, presence, steps, bending, nodding)

#### Resources

### 7. October 31th

Motors and Relays. Controlling Outputs

#### Assignment 

* Make something move or move something. Use copper wiring and electricity to make something move over and over. 
* Bonus: Connect your thing that moves to a sensor circuit.
